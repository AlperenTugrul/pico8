# pico8-games
A collection of unfinished games I've been working on for the past few years. Some games have their source code distributed in multiple files: if needed, you can compile them with my own utility [p8c](https://github.com/lui5fl/p8c) and copy the resulting code to the game's corresponding .p8 file.
