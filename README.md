# pico8-games
A collection of unfinished [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) games I've been working on for the past few years. Some games have their source code distributed in multiple files: if needed, you can compile them with my own utility [p8c](https://github.com/lui5fl/p8c) and copy the resulting code to the game's corresponding .p8 file.

| Game | Year | Description | Preview |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [42](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/tree/master/Projects/42) | 2017 | The objective of this game is very simple: dodge [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#The_Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything_is_42) walls to win! It may seem hard at first, but I assure you that it's possible. | ![42](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/blob/master/Previews/42.gif) |
| [BPM Tap](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/tree/master/Projects/BpmTap) | 2017 | Simple utility to measure a certain BPM by tapping a keyboard button. | ![BpmTap](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/blob/master/Previews/BpmTap.gif) |
| [Bubble Gum](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/tree/master/Projects/BubbleGum) | 2018 | This game, just like [Fika](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/tree/master/Projects/Fika), is another big project I wanted to make. I started having some issues with the physics aspect of the game and I didn't have enough spare time at the moment to solve them, so I stopped working on the game. I really want to get back to it one day though! | ![BubbleGum](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/blob/master/Previews/BubbleGum.gif) |
| [Connect 4](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/tree/master/Projects/Connect4) | 2017 | Recreation of the classic board game, one of my favourites as well. | ![Connect4](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/blob/master/Previews/Connect4.gif) |
| [Desert Bus](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/tree/master/Projects/DesertBus) | 2018 | Rendition of one of the minigames included in the 1995 videogame [*Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_%26_Teller%27s_Smoke_and_Mirrors#Desert_Bus). Even if it were finished, I would advise against playing it... unless you've got 8 hours to spare. | ![DesertBus](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/blob/master/Previews/DesertBus.gif) |
| [Fika](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/tree/master/Projects/Fika) | 2018 | This was supposed to be my first big PICO-8 project, but I couldn't decide on what the gameplay should be like so I left it unfinished. I did make a cool menu and some music to go with it... so check it out! | ![Fika](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/blob/master/Previews/Fika.gif) |
| [Just Win](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/tree/master/Projects/JustWin) | 2018 | Minimalist party game for up to 4 players. Be the last one surviving to win the round. First to reach 10 rounds wins! | ![JustWin](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/blob/master/Previews/JustWin.gif) |
| [Lilbird](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/tree/master/Projects/Lilbird) | 2017 | My first game for PICO-8! Move around and jump to pick up all the golden coins you can before time runs out. | ![Lilbird](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/blob/master/Previews/Lilbird.gif) |
| [Solo Pong](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/tree/master/Projects/SoloPong) | 2017 | Title is self-explanatory. Based off [this game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQzwVDMIfyU): kudos to [Krystian Majewski](https://twitter.com/krystman) for making such great PICO-8 tutorials! | ![SoloPong](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/blob/master/Previews/SoloPong.gif) |
| [Squares](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/tree/master/Projects/Squares) | 2019 | Implementation of the 15-puzzle for PICO-8. | ![Squares](https://github.com/lui5fl/pico8-games/blob/master/Previews/Squares.gif) |
